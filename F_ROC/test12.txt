Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

room:
  def examine()
Thinking...............................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To begin exploring the escape room, I will first call the `examine()` method on the room object to gather more information about the surroundings.

```python
room.examine()
```num_tokens[247]player1
num_thinks[207]player1

player1>room.examine()
[exec] cmd = room.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine()
door:
  def examine()
Thinking............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To determine if the door can be opened or if additional clues are needed, I will examine the door first.

```python
door.examine()
```num_tokens[493]player2
num_thinks[460]player2

player2>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 2
door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine()
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(int)
Thinking..........................................................................................</think>

To gather more details about the room and identify potential items that could help in unlocking the door, I will examine the book first.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[127]player1
num_thinks[90]player1

player1>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 3
book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(int)
Thinking...................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Now that I know the book has the number 1234 inside it, I can use this information to unlock the door.

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[237]player2
num_thinks[195]player2

player2>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
[exec] trying unlock(1234) on door
['1234']
TURN: 4
door.unlock(1234) = True
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine()
Thinking....................................................................................</think>

Now that the door is unlocked, I can proceed to examine room2 by calling its `examine()` method.

```python
room2.examine()
```num_tokens[119]player1
num_thinks[84]player1

player1>room2.examine()
[exec] cmd = room2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2']
TURN: 5
door.unlock(1234) = True

-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine()
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking.........................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To find out more about the papers in the new room, I'll examine paper1 first.

```python
paper1.examine()
```

# Continue?num_tokens[236]player2
num_thinks[201]player2

player2>paper1.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper1.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 6
paper1.examine() = The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking................................................................................</think>

To gather all available information in room2 and potentially find a code for the locked door, I will examine paper2.

```python
paper2.examine()
```num_tokens[116]player1
num_thinks[80]player1

player1>paper2.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 7
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Now that I have both numbers from the papers, I'll combine them as 5214 and attempt to unlock door2.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[286]player2
num_thinks[243]player2

player2>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['5214']
TURN: 8
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(int)
  unlock(5214) = False
Thinking.........................................................................................................</think>

Since door2 requires a 4-digit code and the papers show numbers arranged in rip positions, I will attempt to unlock the door using the reverse order of the numbers found on the papers.

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
```num_tokens[159]player1
num_thinks[105]player1

player1>door2.unlock(1452)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(1452)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(1452) on door2
['5214', '1452']
TURN: 9
door2.unlock(1452) = True
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(1452) = True
room3:
  def examine()
Thinking....................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Now that I've unlocked door2 by using the code from both papers, I'll proceed to examine room3 to find out what's next.

```python
room3.examine()
```

# Continue?num_tokens[241]player2
num_thinks[196]player2

player2>room3.examine()
[exec] cmd = room3.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2', 'room3']
TURN: 10
