Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To start exploring the escape room and gather information about your surroundings, you should examine the room.

```python
obj.examine()
```num_tokens[219]player1
num_thinks[189]player1

player1>obj.examine()
[exec] cmd = obj.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']

To begin exploring the escape room, I'll examine the current environment to gather clues and understand what's available for interaction.

```python
room.examine()
```num_tokens[460]player2
num_thinks[425]player2

player2>room.examine()
[exec] cmd = room.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']
TURN: 2
room.examine() = You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.

-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine()
door:
  def examine()
Thinking....................................................................................</think>

To investigate the book for possible clues, use:

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[105]player1
num_thinks[84]player1

player1>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 3
book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine()
Thinking..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Now that we've found the number 1234 in the book, it seems like a potential key or code for the door. Let's examine the door to see if we can use this clue.

```python
door.examine()
```num_tokens[371]player2
num_thinks[318]player2

player2>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 4
door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(int)
Thinking..........................................................................................</think>

To attempt unlocking the door with the code from the book:

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[117]player1
num_thinks[90]player1

player1>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
[exec] trying unlock(1234) on door
['1234']
TURN: 5
door.unlock(1234) = True
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine()
Thinking....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Now that the door has been successfully unlocked using the code 1234 from the book, let's move on to exploring the newly accessible `room2`.

```python
room2.examine()
```num_tokens[289]player2
num_thinks[244]player2

player2>room2.examine()
[exec] cmd = room2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2']
TURN: 6
door.unlock(1234) = True
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine()
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking.........................................................................</think>

To read the content of the first piece of paper:

```python
paper1.examine()
```num_tokens[96]player1
num_thinks[73]player1

player1>paper1.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper1.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 7
paper1.examine() = The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'

paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Now that I've seen the numbers on paper1, let's examine paper2 to find any additional clues or numbers that might help us unlock door2.

```python
paper2.examine()
```num_tokens[330]player2
num_thinks[287]player2

player2>paper2.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 8
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking............................................................................................................................................</think>

To unlock the next door using the combined numbers from both papers:

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```

Please note: This assumes that the correct way to combine the numbers is by concatenation. If it doesn't work, you might need to try other combinations like 52 + 14 = 66 or arrange them differently.num_tokens[218]player1
num_thinks[140]player1

player1>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['5214']

After examining both pieces of paper in room2, we have the numbers 52 on paper1 (left side) and 14 on paper2 (right side). To unlock door2, which requires a 4-digit code, let's try combining these numbers by placing the left side number first followed by the right side number.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```

If this attempt doesn't work, we can consider other combinations such as 1452 or explore if there are additional clues in the room.num_tokens[390]player2

player2>door2.unlock(5214)

To attempt unlocking door2 with a new code:
