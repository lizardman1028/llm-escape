Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

  def examine()

To begin exploring the escape room, I'll start by examining the room to gather initial clues and information.

```python
room.examine()
```num_tokens[276]player1
num_thinks[244]player1

player1>room.examine()
[exec] cmd = room.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine()
door:
  def examine()
Thinking..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To examine the book and potentially find clues for escaping the room, I will call:

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[298]player2
num_thinks[270]player2

player2>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 2
book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine()
Thinking...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To determine how to proceed, I'll examine the door next.

```python
door.examine()
```num_tokens[347]player1
num_thinks[323]player1

player1>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 3
door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(int)
Thinking.........................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

The book reveals the code "1234". To use this code and attempt to unlock the door, I will call:

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[242]player2
num_thinks[201]player2

player2>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
[exec] trying unlock(1234) on door
['1234']
TURN: 4
door.unlock(1234) = True

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine()
Thinking..........................................................................................................................................</think>

Now that the door is unlocked, I'll examine room2 to explore further.

```python
room2.examine()
```num_tokens[166]player1
num_thinks[138]player1

player1>room2.examine()
[exec] cmd = room2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2']
TURN: 5
door.unlock(1234) = True

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine()
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking..............................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To gather clues from `paper1`, I will call:

```python
paper1.examine()
```num_tokens[198]player2
num_thinks[174]player2

player2>paper1.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper1.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 6
paper1.examine() = The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52

  def unlock(1234) = True

paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To gather more clues, I'll examine paper2 next.

```python
paper2.examine()
```num_tokens[249]player1
num_thinks[225]player1

player1>paper2.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 7
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking...............................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To unlock the door with the combined numbers from both papers, I will call:

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[223]player2
num_thinks[191]player2

player2>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['5214']

  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(int)
  unlock(5214) = False
Thinking............................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

I'll attempt to unlock door2 using the combined numbers from both papers as the code.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[222]player1
num_thinks[188]player1

player1>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']

  unlock(5214) = False
  unlock(5214) = False

I will try unlocking door2 with the code 1452 by calling:

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
```num_tokens[357]player2
num_thinks[324]player2

player2>door2.unlock(1452)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(1452)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(1452) on door2
['5214', '5214', '1452']

door2.unlock(1452) = True

  def unlock(1234) = True

  def unlock(1452) = True
room3:
  def examine()
Thinking.....................................................................................................................................</think>

Now that door2 is unlocked, I'll examine room3 to continue exploring.

```python
room3.examine()
```num_tokens[161]player1
num_thinks[133]player1

player1>room3.examine()
[exec] cmd = room3.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2', 'room3']
