Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To get more information about the room and its layout, which can help identify clues or the next step.

```python

I decide to examine the book to look for clues or information that might help us escape.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[327]player2
num_thinks[298]player2

player2>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']

book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234

book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine()
Thinking......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To see if there's a keypad or lock on the door that might require the code found in the book.

```python
door.examine()
```num_tokens[311]player1
num_thinks[278]player1

player1>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']

door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(int)
Thinking.......................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

The door has been locked, but with the code 1234 found in the book, I will try to unlock it.

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[241]player2
num_thinks[199]player2

player2>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

To explore the newly accessible room and find out what's inside it.

I'll examine paper1 first to see if it contains any clues.

```python

player2>paper1.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper1.examine()

To find out what's written on the second piece of paper that might help unlock door2.

```python
paper2.examine()
```num_tokens[205]player1

player1>paper2.examine()

Combining the numbers from both papers (5214), I will try to unlock door2.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[292]player2

To attempt unlocking door2 with a new combination derived from the numbers on both papers.

```python
door2.unlock(5124)
```

(Note: If 5124 doesn't work, you can try other combinations such as 1452 or 5214 again.)num_tokens[464]player1

player1>door2.unlock(5124)

I will attempt to unlock door2 with the combined numbers from paper1 and paper2 as 14 followed by 52.

```python
