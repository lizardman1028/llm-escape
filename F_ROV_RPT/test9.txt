pygame 2.6.1 (SDL 2.28.4, Python 3.11.5)
Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To start exploring the escape room and gather more information about its contents, I'll begin by examining the room.

```python
room.examine()
```num_tokens[309]player1
num_thinks[276]player1

player1>room.examine()[exec] cmd = room.examine()
[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']

book:
  def examine()
door:
  def examine()

To investigate the door for potential escape routes, I will examine it.

```python
door.examine()
```num_tokens[285]player2
num_thinks[260]player2

player2>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 1
door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

  def unlock(int)

To find out how to unlock the door, let's examine the book for clues.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[309]player1
num_thinks[281]player1

player1>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234

```python
door.unlock(1234)

player2>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

To gather information from the first piece of paper for potential clues, I will examine it.

```python
paper1.examine()
```num_tokens[217]player2
num_thinks[187]player2

player2>paper1.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper1.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 3
paper1.examine() = The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52

To unlock the second door using the combined numbers from the papers, I will attempt to use the code derived from the numbers on paper1 and paper2.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[509]player2
num_thinks[462]player2

player2>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)
