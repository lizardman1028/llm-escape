pygame 2.6.1 (SDL 2.28.4, Python 3.11.5)
Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To begin exploring the escape room, I decide to examine the book for any clues.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[277]player2
num_thinks[249]player2

player2>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']

book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

I'll try to unlock the door with the code from the book.

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[216]player2

player2>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

The door unlocks successfully. You enter a new room where there are two pieces of paper on the ground and another locked door.
