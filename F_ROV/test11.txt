Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To start solving the escape room puzzle, it's essential to gather information about the surroundings. Examining the room can reveal hidden clues or objects that are crucial for progressing.

```python
room.examine()
```num_tokens[340]player1
num_thinks[295]player1

player1>room.examine()
[exec] cmd = room.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine()
door:
  def examine()
Thinking..................................................................</think>

I'll start by examining the book to look for any clues or hints that might help us escape.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[97]player2
num_thinks[66]player2

player2>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 2
book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine()
Thinking............................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Now that I know the code from the book is 1234, I should examine the door to see if it can be opened using this code.

```python
door.examine()
```

</think>

The door has a keypad. Please enter the code:
```python
door.use(1234)
```

To solve the puzzle and open the door, we need to use the code found in the book.
```python
door.use(1234)
```num_tokens[322]player1
num_thinks[220]player1

player1>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 3
door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(int)
Thinking........................................................</think>

Let's use the code from the book to unlock the door.

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[84]player2
num_thinks[56]player2

player2>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
[exec] trying unlock(1234) on door
['1234']

door.unlock(1234) = True

  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine()
Thinking.............................................................................................................................................................</think>

Now that the door is unlocked, I should examine room2 to see what's inside and continue solving the escape room.

```python
room2.examine()
```

To find out more about room2, let's examine it.

```python
room2.examine()
```num_tokens[216]player1
num_thinks[157]player1

player1>room2.examine()
[exec] cmd = room2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2']

door.unlock(1234) = True

  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine()
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()

Let's check out the first paper to look for any additional clues.

```python
paper1.examine()
```num_tokens[75]player2
num_thinks[49]player2

player2>paper1.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper1.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 6
paper1.examine() = The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking.................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Next, I should examine paper2 to find any additional clues that might be needed for door2.

```python
paper2.examine()
```

To gather more information from the second piece of paper, let's examine it.

```python
paper2.examine()
```num_tokens[219]player1
num_thinks[161]player1

player1>paper2.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']

paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14

  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking...............................................................................................</think>

Let's try combining the numbers from both papers to unlock door2.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[125]player2
num_thinks[95]player2

player2>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['5214']
TURN: 8
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14

  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'

  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(int)
  unlock(5214) = False
Thinking......................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Let's try using the combined code 5214 to unlock door2.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```

I'll attempt to unlock door2 with the combination from both papers.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[227]player1
num_thinks[166]player1

player1>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['5214', '5214']

door2.unlock(5214) = False

  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'

  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(int)
  unlock(5214) = False
  unlock(5214) = False
Thinking...................................................................</think>

Let's try reversing the order of the numbers to unlock door2.

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
```
</think>

I'll attempt unlocking door2 with 1452 this time.

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
```

---

The function `unlock` is called on `door2` with the argument `1452`.

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
```num_tokens[164]player2
num_thinks[67]player2

player2>door2.unlock(1452)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(1452)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(1452) on door2
['5214', '5214', '1452']

  def unlock(1452) = True
room3:
  def examine()
Thinking.....................................................................................................................</think>

Now that door2 is unlocked, I should examine room3 to continue exploring.

```python
room3.examine()
```

To proceed further into the escape room, let's examine room3.

```python
room3.examine()
```num_tokens[169]player1
num_thinks[117]player1

player1>room3.examine()
[exec] cmd = room3.examine()
