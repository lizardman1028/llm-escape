Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To begin exploring the escape room, I'll start by examining the room to gather more information about our surroundings.

```python
room.examine()
```num_tokens[449]player1
num_thinks[416]player1

player1>room.examine()
[exec] cmd = room.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']

book:
  def examine()
door:
  def examine()

To explore potential clues within the room, examine the book first for any hidden information that might help unlock the door.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[488]player2
num_thinks[454]player2

player2>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 2
book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234

  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'

door:
  def examine()
Thinking.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To use the code found in the book, let's examine the door next.

```python
door.examine()
```num_tokens[484]player1
num_thinks[457]player1

player1>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 3
door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(int)
Thinking......................................................................................................................</think>

I'll use the numbers from the book to unlock the door.

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[146]player2
num_thinks[118]player2

player2>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
[exec] trying unlock(1234) on door
['1234']

door.unlock(1234) = True

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'

  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'

  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine()
Thinking..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Since you've unlocked the door using the code from the book, the next logical step is to examine the new room that has become accessible. 

```python
room2.examine()
```num_tokens[311]player1
num_thinks[270]player1

player1>room2.examine()
[exec] cmd = room2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2']
TURN: 5
door.unlock(1234) = True

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine()
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking....................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To proceed further in the escape room, I need to examine the contents of paper1 to gather more clues for unlocking door2.

```python
paper1.examine()
```num_tokens[234]player2
num_thinks[196]player2

player2>paper1.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper1.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 6
paper1.examine() = The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52

  def unlock(1234) = True

paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To find the next clue needed for unlocking door2, we'll examine paper2.

```python
paper2.examine()
```num_tokens[299]player1
num_thinks[270]player1

player1>paper2.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 7
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To unlock door2, combine the numbers from paper1 and paper2, placing them side by side as indicated by their ripped edges.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[313]player2
num_thinks[270]player2

player2>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['5214']
TURN: 8
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(int)
  unlock(5214) = False

To solve the puzzle in room2, I combined the numbers from both papers considering their rip positions. Since Paper1 was ripped on the left with 52 and Paper2 on the right with 14, arranging them as 14 (right) followed by 52 (left) forms the code 1452.

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
```num_tokens[450]player1
num_thinks[365]player1

player1>door2.unlock(1452)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(1452)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(1452) on door2
['5214', '1452']
TURN: 9
door2.unlock(1452) = True

  def unlock(1234) = True

  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'

  def unlock(1452) = True
room3:
  def examine()

To proceed after unlocking door2 into room3, you should examine the new environment to uncover further clues or objectives.

```python
room3.examine()
```num_tokens[444]player2
num_thinks[409]player2

player2>room3.examine()
[exec] cmd = room3.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2', 'room3']
