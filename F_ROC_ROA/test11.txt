Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To start exploring the escape room and gather initial information, examine the room.

```python
room.examine()

num_thinks[262]player1

player1>room.examine()
[exec] cmd = room.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']

  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine()

To investigate the book for potential clues, I'll examine it.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[231]player2
num_thinks[207]player2

player2>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']

book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234

Let's examine the door next!  
```python
door.examine()

num_thinks[440]player1

player1>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']

door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(int)
Thinking.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To unlock the door using the code found in the book:

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[256]player2
num_thinks[229]player2

player2>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

[exec] trying unlock(1234) on door

  def unlock(1234) = True

To explore the newly accessible area after unlocking the door, we should examine room2 for any new clues or items.

```python
room2.examine()
```num_tokens[144]player1

player1>room2.examine()
[exec] cmd = room2.examine()

  def unlock(1234) = True

To solve the puzzle, I'll examine paper2 for any clues or numbers needed to unlock the next door.

```python
paper2.examine()
```num_tokens[309]player1
num_thinks[275]player1

player1>paper2.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']

  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'

  def examine()

To unlock door2 using the combined code from both papers:

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[680]player2
num_thinks[652]player2

player2>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['5214']
TURN: 8
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(int)
  unlock(5214) = False
Thinking...........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To solve the puzzle, I considered combining the numbers from both papers. Since paper1 had 52 on the left and paper2 had 14 on the right, I initially tried 5214 but it didn't work. Then, considering the possibility that the order might matter based on their ripped sides, I rearranged them to form 1452.

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
```num_tokens[584]player1
num_thinks[491]player1

player1>door2.unlock(1452)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(1452)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(1452) on door2
['5214', '1452']
TURN: 9
door2.unlock(1452) = True

  def unlock(1452) = True

  def examine()

To proceed further into the escape room, we should now examine room3 and its contents by calling:

```python
room3.examine()
```

This action will provide more details about what's inside room3, allowing us to continue solving the puzzle.num_tokens[456]player2
num_thinks[402]player2

player2>room3.examine()
[exec] cmd = room3.examine()
