Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To start exploring the escape room and gather initial information, we'll examine the room.

```python
room.examine()
```num_tokens[516]player1
num_thinks[488]player1

player1>room.examine()
[exec] cmd = room.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine()
door:
  def examine()
Thinking........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To begin solving the escape room, I will examine the book for potential clues.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[403]player2
num_thinks[376]player2

player2>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 2
book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine()
Thinking................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

It seems like there's a door in the room and a book that contains a code. The next logical step would be to examine the door to see if you can use the code from the book.

```python
door.examine()
```num_tokens[291]player1
num_thinks[240]player1

player1>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 3
door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(int)
Thinking..............................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

The door is locked, but we have a code from the book (1234). Let's try using it.

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[230]player2
num_thinks[190]player2

player2>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
[exec] trying unlock(1234) on door
['1234']
TURN: 4
door.unlock(1234) = True

  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'

door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine()
Thinking...............................................................................................................................</think>

To explore further, I'll examine room2 to find new clues.

```python
room2.examine()
```num_tokens[153]player1
num_thinks[127]player1

player1>room2.examine()
[exec] cmd = room2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2']
TURN: 5
door.unlock(1234) = True

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine()
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To proceed in the escape room, I will examine paper1 to uncover any clues it holds that might help unlock door2.

```python
paper1.examine()
```num_tokens[554]player2
num_thinks[517]player2

player2>paper1.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper1.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 6
paper1.examine() = The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52

  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'

  def unlock(1234) = True

  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'

  def examine()

  def examine()
Thinking........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To proceed further in the escape room, I will examine the second piece of paper to obtain the necessary information needed to unlock the next door.

```python
paper2.examine()
```num_tokens[640]player1
num_thinks[600]player1

player1>paper2.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 7
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To solve the puzzle, we'll attempt combining the numbers from both pieces of paper into a four-digit code.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[635]player2
num_thinks[597]player2

player2>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['5214']
TURN: 8
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(int)
  unlock(5214) = False
Thinking................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To attempt to unlock door2 using the combined code derived from the numbers on paper1 and paper2:

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
```num_tokens[501]player1
num_thinks[464]player1

player1>door2.unlock(1452)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(1452)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(1452) on door2
['5214', '1452']
TURN: 9
door2.unlock(1452) = True

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'

  def unlock(1452) = True
room3:
  def examine()
Thinking....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To proceed in room3, I'll examine it to find any new clues or objects.

```python
room3.examine()
```num_tokens[338]player2
num_thinks[308]player2

player2>room3.examine()
[exec] cmd = room3.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2', 'room3']
