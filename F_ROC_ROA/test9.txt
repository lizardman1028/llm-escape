Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To start gathering information about the escape room, we'll examine the current room.

```python
room.examine()
```num_tokens[296]player1
num_thinks[269]player1

player1>obj.examine()[exec] cmd = obj.examine()
[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']

To begin exploring the escape room, I'll examine the current environment to uncover potential clues and objects.

```python
room.examine()
```num_tokens[333]player2
num_thinks[302]player2

player2>room.examine()
[exec] cmd = room.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']
TURN: 2
room.examine() = You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine()
door:
  def examine()
Thinking...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To find clues that might help in opening the door, let's examine the book.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[843]player1
num_thinks[815]player1

player1>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 3
book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine()
Thinking...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Since you've found the code "1234" in the book, the next logical step would be to use this code on the door. However, since the only available function for the door is `examine()`, I'll call that to potentially reveal more information about how to proceed.

```python
door.examine()
```num_tokens[502]player2
num_thinks[431]player2

player2>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 4
door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(int)
Thinking..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To proceed, we'll use the code from the book to unlock the door.

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[445]player1
num_thinks[414]player1

player1>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
[exec] trying unlock(1234) on door
['1234']
TURN: 5
door.unlock(1234) = True
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine()
Thinking.........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To proceed into the newly unlocked room, we examine `room2`:

```python
room2.examine()
```num_tokens[580]player2
num_thinks[553]player2

player2>room2.examine()
[exec] cmd = room2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2']
TURN: 6
door.unlock(1234) = True
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine()
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To find clues needed to unlock the next door, examine paper1 for any useful information.

```python
paper1.examine()
```num_tokens[342]player1
num_thinks[312]player1

player1>paper1.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper1.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 7
paper1.examine() = The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To proceed further, let's examine the second piece of paper to gather any additional clues that might help us unlock door2.

```python
paper2.examine()
```num_tokens[347]player2
num_thinks[310]player2

player2>paper2.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 8
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14
Updated World State
-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To unlock door2, I will concatenate the numbers from paper1 and paper2 in the order they were found (paper1 first on the left, then paper2 on the right). This gives me 5214.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[557]player1
num_thinks[495]player1

player1>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['5214']
TURN: 9
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(int)
  unlock(5214) = False

The combination of the numbers from both papers could be arranged as 14 followed by 52, making it 1452.

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
```num_tokens[975]player2
num_thinks[930]player2

player2>door2.unlock(1452)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(1452)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(1452) on door2
['5214', '1452']
TURN: 10
door2.unlock(1452) = True

  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'

  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(1452) = True
room3:
  def examine()
Thinking....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To proceed into room3 after unlocking door2 with the code 1452, the next logical step is to examine room3.

```python
room3.examine()
```num_tokens[444]player1
num_thinks[404]player1

player1>room3.examine()
[exec] cmd = room3.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2', 'room3']
