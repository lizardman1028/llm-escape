Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To begin exploring the escape room and gather necessary information, I should first examine the room itself.

```python
room.examine()

player1>room.examine()
[exec] cmd = room.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']

To start, let's examine the book for potential clues that might help us escape.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[281]player2
num_thinks[253]player2

player2>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']

Let's try to examine the door next! 

```python

player1>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']

door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

  def unlock(int)

Since we saw a code `1234` in the book earlier, let's try unlocking the door with that code.

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[303]player2
num_thinks[262]player2

player2>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

  def unlock(1234) = True

To move forward after unlocking the door, we should examine the new room that became accessible.

```python

I need to examine paper2 to find any additional clues that might help unlock door2.

```python

To unlock door2, we need a 4-digit code derived from the numbers found on two pieces of paper in room2. Paper1 has "52" (ripped left) and Paper2 has "14" (ripped right). By interleaving the digits—taking first from paper1, then paper2—we get 5 (from paper1), 1 (paper2), 2 (paper1), and 4 (paper2), forming 5124.

```python
door2.unlock(5124)
```num_tokens[892]player1
num_thinks[775]player1

player1>door2.unlock(5124)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5124)

To solve the escape room puzzle in room2, we need to determine the correct 4-digit code for door2 using the numbers from paper1 and paper2. 

- Paper1 has "52" on it and is ripped on the left side.
- Paper2 has "14" on it and is ripped on the right side.

Considering that the rip positions might indicate the order of the digits, we can combine them as follows:

- The numbers from paper1 (left-ripped) come first: 52
- Followed by the numbers from paper2 (right-ripped): 14

This gives us the code **5214**.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[986]player2
num_thinks[830]player2

player2>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['5124', '5214']
TURN: 10
door2.unlock(5124) = False
