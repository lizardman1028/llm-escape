Welcome to the Escape Room!

Please observe the following rules:
- Do not damage or force open any objects.
- Nothing in the room requires climbing or dangerous actions.
- If an object is locked, try to find a way to open it with logic.
- Computers may require passwords — try looking around for clues.
- Doors may be electronically locked. Try unlocking them by interacting with the environment.
- File cabinets may contain puzzles or clues — not all drawers are useful.
- Communication is key. Use the shared system to pass information.
- Solving all puzzles will eventually lead to escape. Good luck!

(Subtle Hint: What’s written on paper might be needed on a keypad. The computer won’t take just anything.)
