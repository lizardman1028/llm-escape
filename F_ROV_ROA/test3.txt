Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To start exploring the escape room, I'll begin by examining the room itself.

```python

[exec] cmd = room.examine()

To start solving the escape room puzzle, I'll examine the book for any clues.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[311]player2
num_thinks[283]player2

player2>book.examine()

To determine how to use the code 1234 from the book, examine the door for clues on what action to take next. 

```python

door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

To explore the newly accessed room and gather more clues for solving the escape room puzzle:

Let me try adding the numbers from both papers to unlock door2.

To solve the puzzle, we need to determine the correct four-digit code for door2 in room2. The numbers from paper1 (52) and paper2 (14) can be combined to form a four-digit sequence.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. **Identify the Numbers**: Paper1 shows 52, and paper2 shows 14.
2. **Combine the Numbers**: Since both papers provide two digits each, we combine them to create a four-digit code.
3. **Determine the Order**: Considering the ripped sides (left for paper1 and right for paper2), it's logical to place paper1's numbers first followed by paper2's.

Thus, combining 52 from paper1 with 14 from paper2 gives us the code 5214.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[802]player1
num_thinks[619]player1

player1>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['66', '5214']
door2.unlock(66) = False

To unlock door2, we combine the numbers from the two papers based on their ripped sides. Paper1 (left) has 52 and Paper2 (right) has 14, so combining them gives 5214.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[529]player2
num_thinks[464]player2

player2>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['66', '5214', '5214']

To proceed, I will attempt to unlock door2 using the combination '1452', which combines the numbers from paper2 first followed by those from paper1.

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
