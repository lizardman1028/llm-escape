Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is player1. You are in an escape room with another player player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

To begin exploring the escape room and gather necessary information, I will start by examining the room.

```python
room.examine()

num_thinks[227]player1

player1>room.examine()
[exec] cmd = room.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room']

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine()
door:
  def examine()
Thinking......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To explore the available options and gather potential clues from the room, I'll start by examining the book.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[614]player2
num_thinks[582]player2

player2>book.examine()
[exec] cmd = book.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
TURN: 1
book.examine() = There's something written inside: 1234

-------------------
room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine()
Thinking....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To address the escape room challenge, after finding "1234" in the book, examining the door could reveal a lock that requires this code. The next step is to check the door for clues.

```python
door.examine()
```num_tokens[457]player1
num_thinks[404]player1

player1>door.examine()
[exec] cmd = door.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
door.examine() = A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(int)
Thinking...............................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To proceed, we'll use the number from the book to attempt unlocking the door.

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```num_tokens[239]player2
num_thinks[207]player2

player2>door.unlock(1234)
[exec] cmd = door.unlock(1234)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door']
[exec] trying unlock(1234) on door
['1234']
TURN: 2
door.unlock(1234) = True

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:

  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine()
Thinking..................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

Now that you've successfully unlocked the door, the next logical step is to explore the new area by examining room2.

```python
room2.examine()
```num_tokens[374]player1
num_thinks[338]player1

player1>room2.examine()
[exec] cmd = room2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2']
door.unlock(1234) = True

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine()
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To proceed, let's examine paper1 for any clues that might help unlock the next door.

```python
paper1.examine()
```num_tokens[293]player2
num_thinks[262]player2

player2>paper1.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper1.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
TURN: 3
paper1.examine() = The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52

  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'

  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine()
door2:
  def examine()
Thinking............................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To find any additional clues, I'll examine paper2.

```python
paper2.examine()
```num_tokens[228]player1
num_thinks[204]player1

player1>paper2.examine()
[exec] cmd = paper2.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
paper2.examine() = The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14

  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'

  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:

door2:
  def examine()
Thinking.......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................</think>

To solve the puzzle in room2, combine the numbers from paper1 and paper2. Since paper1 is ripped on the left (52) and paper2 on the right (14), arrange them as 52 followed by 14 to form 5214.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```num_tokens[466]player2
num_thinks[391]player2

player2>door2.unlock(5214)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5214)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5214) on door2
['5214']

  def unlock(1234) = True

  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:

  unlock(5214) = False

To unlock door2 using the numbers from paper1 (52 on the left) and paper2 (14 on the right), arranging them in an interleaved order of 5, 1, 2, 4 gives us the code 5124.

```python
door2.unlock(5124)
```num_tokens[749]player1
num_thinks[677]player1

player1>door2.unlock(5124)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(5124)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(5124) on door2
['5214', '5124']
door2.unlock(5214) = False

  unlock(5214) = False
  unlock(5124) = False

To unlock door2, I'll try combining the numbers from the papers in a different order.

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
```num_tokens[392]player2
num_thinks[357]player2

player2>door2.unlock(1452)
[exec] cmd = door2.unlock(1452)

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2']
[exec] trying unlock(1452) on door2
['5214', '5124', '1452']
TURN: 5
door2.unlock(1452) = True
Updated World State

room:
  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(1452) = True
room3:
  def examine()
Thinking.....</think>

To proceed to room3, I need to call `room3.examine()`.

```python
room3.examine()
```num_tokens[34]player1
num_thinks[5]player1

player1>room3.examine()
[exec] cmd = room3.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2', 'room3']
door2.unlock(1452) = True

  def examine() = 'You are in a big room. You see a book and a door.'
book:
  def examine() = 'There's something written inside: 1234'
door:
  def examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
  def unlock(1234) = True
room2:
  def examine() = 'You see two pieces of paper on the ground along with another locked door, the papers are indexed arbitrarily'
paper1:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its left side, on it are the numbers 52'
paper2:
  def examine() = 'The paper is ripped on its right side, on it are the numbers 14'
door2:
  def examine() = 'A locked door with a 4 digit lock'
  def unlock(1452) = True

  def examine() = 'You Escaped the Rooms! Congrats!'

Since door2 has been unlocked with the correct code (1452), you have successfully moved to room3 where you've escaped. There are no further actions required as the objective is already accomplished.

```python
room3.examine()
```num_tokens[378]player2
num_thinks[325]player2

player2>room3.examine()
[exec] cmd = room3.examine()

[exec] agent revealed_items = ['room', 'book', 'door', 'room2', 'paper1', 'paper2', 'door2', 'room3']
TURN: 6
