Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html
Hi! Your name is LLM_player. You are in an escape room with another player LLM_player2! This escape room is specified through a series of Python Objects, and you can interact with the world in this way.Here are the objects in the room and their associated functions, the room will update as you and your teamate interact with it. For your response, you may ONLY respond with a single python function call present in the API.
 Your response is ONE line of python annotated with markdown ```python obj.examine() ```. You may not try multiple functions.

I will examine the room to gather more information about our surroundings.

The room has a book and a door. Let me examine the book first to see if it contains any useful information.

```python
book.examine()
```num_tokens[276]LLM_player2

door.examine()

The book has the numbers 1234 written inside. Let me examine the door to see if I can use this information.

```python
door.examine()
```

door.examine() = 'A locked door. Maybe it leads somewhere.'
door.unlock(int)
Thinking..........................................................................................................................................................</think>

The door is locked and I suspect the number 1234 from the book might be the key. Let me try unlocking the door with this code.

```python
door.unlock(1234)
```

The door was successfully unlocked with code 1234. Let me examine room2 to see what's inside.

```python
room2.examine()
```

In room2, there are two pieces of paper on the ground. Let me examine the first one to see if it contains any useful information.

```python
paper1.examine()
```

Now that I've examined paper1 which has 52 written on it, let me examine paper2 to see if it provides more clues.

```python
paper2.examine()
```

door2.examine()

The papers have numbers 52 and 14. Combining them gives 5214 or 1452. Let me try unlocking door2 with 5214.

```python
door2.unlock(5214)
```

Since entering 5214 into door2 did not unlock it, let me try reversing the numbers to see if that works. I'll use 1452 as the code.

```python
door2.unlock(1452)
```
